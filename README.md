# Webtops
Webtop are desktops in your browser, that help you navigate the web.
Custom [Widgets](#Widgets) allow you to gather all the information you want in one place and
quickly navigate them with [Shortcuts](#Shortcuts) and it's custom [CLI](#CLI).
[Check it out](https://webcli.dev)!

## Quick-StartðŸš€
Your Webtops have three unique features: [Shortcuts](docs/shortcuts.md), the [CLI](docs/cli.md) and [Widgets](docs/widgets.md). The special part: The ready-made ones are fully customisable and you can add your own widgets and commands.
The following gives you a quick overview of how to get started with your own Webtop.

Hold `CTRL + ALT` to access the help page.
Rotate to the next Webtop with `ALT + SHIFT` or jump directly to one by pressing `ALT + DIGIT`.

The CLI gets activated by typing ":" into the searchbar.
From there on you have access to a range of commands. Here are some examples:
Search [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) for a question with **so**:
```
: so check if a str is numeric
```
Set environment variables just as in the terminal with **set**:
```
: set PRESENT "The Ruins of Gorlan"
``` 
Search [Amazon](https://amazon.com/) for book with asc prices with the **amz** command:
```
: amz $PRESENT -s asc
```
Open your localhost (127.0.0.1) on port 8080 with **l**:
```
: l 8080
```
Look up German laws with the **Â§** command:
```
: Â§ 20 GG
```
To see all commands go [here](docs/cli.md) or type into your Webtop CLI:
```
: help <command>
```
